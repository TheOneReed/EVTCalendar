## Usage

EVTCalendar is a project to implement a somewhat blizz-like calendar addon to WoW V1.12.1.
This replaces the clock in the top right with a calendar button. Alternatively, the calendar can be brought up with "/evt".

This calendar has PARTY/RAID/GUILD communications, and all invites are done through these channels. Blizzard did not
introduce addon capable WHISPER communications until V2.0. Because there is no access to a serverside database, this 
calendar is NOT live updating, but works on an invite/confirmation process. The person you want to invite MUST be online
for them to recieve it. Alternatively, if you wish to confirm yourself for an event, the event creator must be online.

For issue or bugs, please submit an issue ticket at https://github.com/TheOneReed/EVTCalendar/issues with a description of what you
were doing, or a screenshot of the error message!

Thank you for your interest in EVTCalendar!
